Pandas to import, clean, and sort data
Used Seaborn to visualize data as scatterplots
Used bokeh to create interactive scatterplots
Plotted the average age and the net wins of baseball teams to see if there was a correlation between them


Built a model to recognize which type of iris flower a given iris flower is
Used the k nearest neighbor classifier to create the model
Compared the predictions to the actual outputs to test how accurate the model is
Learned about model persistence using joblib
